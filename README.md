# Digital-Well-Being-for-Mobile-Gaming

## Introduction and Proposed Approach
The fundamental issue addressed by this project is the excessive screen time and potential digital addiction faced by mobile gamers, particularly young users. Excessive screen time and its impact on both physical and mental health inspired us to create a solution.

Our approach was methodical. Starting from user research involving surveys and detailed interviews with over 150 participants, we transitioned to paper prototyping to visualize our ideas, and then to a dynamic software prototype. The main goal of the software is to help users manage their gaming habits and promote a healthier lifestyle by providing tools that reduce the risks linked to excessive digital use.

Key features of the app include a dual-dashboard system for both parents and children. Parents can monitor and control aspects like screen time, bedtime, and content filters, while sending approval requests for game access. The child/general user dashboard enhances user engagement with features like focus mode, quests, challenges, and a dynamic avatar named Zenith that changes expressions based on user behavior. This interactive approach encourages users to reflect on their gaming habits and strive for a healthier digital life
